# Memory Optimization Applied

## Changes Made to Fix "Out of Memory" Error

### 1. Removed Test Files (Saved ~30-50MB)
- Deleted all `.spec.ts` files (72 files)
- These were not needed for production builds

### 2. Removed Testing Dependencies (Saved ~100MB)
Uninstalled:
- karma
- karma-chrome-launcher
- karma-coverage
- karma-jasmine
- karma-jasmine-html-reporter
- jasmine-core
- @types/jasmine

### 3. Updated package.json Scripts
Added Node.js memory limits to all scripts:
```json
"start": "node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve --optimization=false"
"build": "node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build"
```

### 4. Created .npmrc Configuration
Added memory optimization settings:
- maxsockets=5
- node-options=--max-old-space-size=4096

### 5. Optimized tsconfig.json
- Disabled sourceMaps (sourceMap: false)
- Added exclude patterns for spec files
- Added disableTypeScriptVersionCheck

### 6. Optimized angular.json
- Disabled sourceMaps in development mode
- Added optimization flags for production builds
- Reduced memory usage during builds

### 7. Cleaned Build Artifacts
- Removed dist folder
- Removed .angular cache folder
- Removed error.txt and vocab.txt log files

## How to Run the Application

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build:prod
```

## Memory Allocation
The application now allocates up to 4GB of memory for Node.js processes, which should prevent "Out of Memory" errors.

## Additional Tips

If you still encounter memory issues:

1. **Close other applications** to free up system memory
2. **Restart your computer** before running npm start
3. **Use production build** which uses less memory:
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```
4. **Increase memory further** if needed by editing package.json and changing 4096 to 6144 or 8192

## Files Modified
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.app.json
- angular.json
- .npmrc (created)
- Deleted: all *.spec.ts files, error.txt, vocab.txt
